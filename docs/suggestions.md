### **HTML Parsing Goals**

#### **Entities like `&nbsp;`, `&amp;`, etc.:**
- **Suggestion:** Handle entity decoding to provide clean, human-readable content (e.g., `&amp;` → `&`, `&nbsp;` → space).
  - **Why?** Decoding these entities will make the content easier to work with for most use cases.
  - **Implementation Note:** This can be done during the parsing stage by converting entities to their decoded form.

### **Tree Representation**

#### **Metadata for Nodes:**
- **Suggestion:** Include optional metadata like the position of the tag in the original document.
  - **Why?** 
    - This is helpful for debugging, error reporting, or reconstructing the HTML exactly as it was parsed.
    - If you don’t need it now, it can be added later with minimal impact.

#### **Whitespace Representation:**
- **Suggestion:** Do not explicitly represent whitespace as standalone nodes; only include structural elements.
  - **Why?**
    - Whitespace often isn’t meaningful in HTML, and ignoring it will reduce complexity.
    - If needed (e.g., for pretty-printing), whitespace can still be preserved in the raw content during parsing.

#### **Pointers to Parent Nodes:**
- **Advantages of Including Parent Pointers:**
  - Enables **bidirectional traversal**, making it easier to:
    - Move up the DOM tree (e.g., finding ancestors or determining the context of a node).
    - Query relationships like siblings more efficiently (e.g., finding the "next sibling").
  - Useful for operations like **breadcrumb navigation** (tracing a node's path in the tree).
- **Recommendation:** Include parent pointers. While it adds a small overhead, the flexibility it provides outweighs the cost.

### **Navigation and Queries**

#### **CSS Selector Navigation:**
- **Suggestion:** Implement a hybrid approach:
  - Start with simple methods like `FindByTag`, `FindByID`, and `FindByClass`.
  - Later, consider adding support for basic CSS selectors if needed (e.g., `div > p.class-name`).
  - **Why?**
    - Simple methods are faster to implement and sufficient for most basic navigation tasks.
    - Adding CSS-like selectors can enhance usability for advanced users in the future.

#### **DOM-Style Traversal and Search:**
- **Suggestion:** Include both DOM-style traversal (`parent`, `child`, `sibling`) and a high-level search API.
  - **Why?**
    - DOM-style traversal is useful for step-by-step navigation.
    - High-level search (e.g., `FindAllByTag`) is more efficient for finding specific elements in a larger tree.

### **Extensibility**

#### **XML or Other Formats:**
- **Suggestion:** Design the parser with a clean interface but don't add explicit support for XML now.
  - **Why?**
    - Keeping it focused on HTML simplifies the implementation.
    - Future extensions to XML can be considered if needed, as the core logic for parsing structured documents will be similar.

#### **Plugins or Hooks:**
- **Suggestion:** Skip this for now, as you don't plan to use custom tag handling.

### **Performance**

#### **Efficiency for Large Documents:**
- **Suggestion:** Optimize for simplicity and correctness rather than extreme performance.
  - Parsing the entire document into memory is acceptable given performance is not a key concern.
  - Streaming mode or lazy loading can be considered in the future if needed.
